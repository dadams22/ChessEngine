# Simple Chess Engine

This is a simple chess engine that I created in my senior year of high school (2017-18).

By no means is the code anywhere near perfect. This project was very early on in my journey as a developer and I have grown tremendously since.

That being said, I was quite proud of this project when I initially made it and it was a great learning experience at the time.

## Usage

To use this project, first clone the repository.

The game can be started by navigating to the project directory and running

```python
python game.py
```

Note that this project requires Python 3 and the python-chess library
